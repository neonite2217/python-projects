# Python Projects Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of small python projects ranging from beginner-friendly to advanced, which I've created throughout my learning journey. Whether you're looking to learn Python, sharpen your skills, or explore new libraries and techniques, or just curious, you'll find something interesting here.

## Installation

To get started with any project in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/neonite2217/python-projects

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd python-projects

3. Install any necessary dependencies(I've mention where-ever required):
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it. As all the projects require it. 
Also pip3 / python3 are commands for Linux/ Mac OS while Windows OS users can just ignore that 3 in the end.

## Usage

Each project in this repository comes with its own set of instructions for usage. Please refer to the README.md file within each project directory for specific details.

## Projects

1. **Automated Mailing** - A simple Python application that fetches email credentials and automates sending mails


Feel free to explore each project and experiment with the code!

## License

This repository is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the creators of the libraries and APIs used in these projects.
- Inspired by the vibrant Python community and its commitment to learning and collaboration.
- Thanks to open source learning(youtube,medium, reddit, stackoverflow,Geekforgeeks,W3schools) helped whenever I stumbled

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any ideas for new projects, improvements to existing ones, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Steps To Follow

- Select an issue and ask to be _assigned_ to it.
- Check existing scripts in the [projects](/projects/) directory.
- **Star** this repository.
- On the [python-projects](https://github.com/neonite2217/python-projects) repo page, click the **Fork** button.

- **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine. This button will show you the URL to run.

    For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/python-projects.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

    Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/neonite2217/python-projects.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master
    git push
    ```
    
    Alternatively, GitHub also provides syncing now - click "Fetch upstream" at the top of your repo below "Code" button.

- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).

- Checkout to development branch (*name your branch according to the issue name*).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

- Create a folder in
  [projects directory](https://github.com/neonite2217/python-projects/tree/master/projects)
  according to issue name.
- Write your code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.
- Don't forget to add a `README.md` in your folder
- Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<your message>"
    ```

- Push the code _to your repository_.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

- Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and **make a pull request**:

    Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
- Now wait, until I *review your Pull Request*! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
