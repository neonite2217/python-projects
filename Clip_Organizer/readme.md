## üõ†Ô∏è Description
This script takes in a directory of video clips, and outputs one video clip featuring all of the input clips.
However, it plays them back in real time. For example, if you filmed a one minute clip from 5:01 to 5:02, and another one minute clip from 5:05 to 5:06, the output clip would be 5 minutes in length. The first minute of the output clip would be the first input clip, then there would be 3 minutes of just a black screen. Finally, the last minute of hte output clip would be the second input clip. This is useful for syncing up b-roll and organizing clips.
