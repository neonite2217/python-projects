## üéÆ How to Play

- Run the script with Python
- The game window will appear with two paddles and a ball in the middle.
- Use the arrow keys to control your paddle (Player 1) up and down.
- The CPU controls the other paddle (Player 2).
- The game starts when you press any arrow key. The ball will start moving in a random direction.
- The goal is to bounce the ball past your opponent's paddle and score points.
- The game continues until one player reaches the specified maximum score i.e. 10 points.
